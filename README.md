# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **computer science enthusiast** currently pursuing my Master's in High Performance Computing at Chalmers University of Technology, where I also completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm on track to graduate in summer 2025.

Currently, I work part-time at **Ericsson**, where I apply my skills to real-world challenges and contribute to innovative projects. With **two years of full-time experience in C++**, Iâ€™ve developed a strong passion for writing robust, reliable code. Iâ€™m especially drawn to projects with **high safety requirements**, where rigorous CI processes, static analysis, unit-testing, and coding standards are prioritized to ensure robust and maintainable software.

Recently, Iâ€™ve been deeply involved in **Chalmers Formula Student**, focusing on the embedded software for the car's systems. I helped create a Battery Management System (BMS) and led the restructuring and unit-testing of the entire codebase. Additionally, I developed a client for our in-house inverters using **C++20**, setting up a modular **CMake build system** that cross-compiles to both Windows and Linux. These projects have refined my skills in code architecture, structure, and the latest C++ standards.

I primarily code in **C++**, with experience in tools like **clangd**, **Clang**, **CMake**, and some **C**. Outside of tech, I enjoy unwinding with walks or runs through the forest.

Looking ahead, Iâ€™m interested in contributing to **open-source projects** and eventually working in **high-safety fields** like aerospace or defense, where robust and secure software is critical. Feel free to reach out if youâ€™re interested in collaborating, Iâ€™d love to connect!
