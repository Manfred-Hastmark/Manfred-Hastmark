# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **computer science enthusiast** currently pursuing my Master's in High Performance Computing at Chalmers University of Technology, where I also completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm on track to graduate in summer 2025.

Currently, I work part-time at **Ericsson**, where I develop in C++. I'm also part of [Chalmers Formula Student](https://www.chalmersformulastudent.se/) as a manager, however I'm still doing some coding 
sidequests there still :).

My main interests are in setting up Linux environments and messing around with operating systems. Recently I have been exploring FreeBSD as a daily driver.
I also enjoy coding in C++ :).

If you want to see what I'm up to, I would recommend checking out [this](https://github.com/Manfred-Hastmark/fzf-folder) simple program I made to explore C++ modules, and also [this](https://github.com/Manfred-Hastmark/dotfiles) repository where I keep
all my dotfiles.
